start:

	; cmp is an if statement, checking if it's null terminated, thats how it knows to stop
	; it means "Compare"
	cmp al, 0
	je done		; If it's null terminated, call "done"

	; Print the string with the bios's help
	int 0x10	; 'al' already contains the char

	; increment pointer and do next loop, like a for loop
	add bx, 1	; REMEMBER BX FROM THE START?
	jmp start	; Loop back to "start"

; Go back to previous code

; Print_nl is easier because it's just fixed characters
; no getting strings and looping through them
